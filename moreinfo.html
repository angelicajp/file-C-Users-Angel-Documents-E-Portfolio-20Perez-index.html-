<h4>Hello! I'm Angelica Jade Perez, the oldest in my family, raised by my wonderful parents, Genevieve Perez and Jose Sadjid Perez. I have two siblings: my younger sister Christine and my youngest brother Xian. Being the oldest has taught me a lot about responsibility and caring for others.
<br>
<br>
I have a variety of interests that keep me engaged and happy. I love reading manhwa, as the intricate stories and beautiful illustrations captivate me. Dancing is another passion of mine, especially hip-hop, which allows me to express myself and stay active. I also enjoy playing video games, as they provide an exciting escape and a way to connect with friends. While I practiced karate for some time, I'm currently on a break from it.
<br>
<br>
In my downtime, you can often find me on my phone or catching up on sleep—there’s nothing quite like recharging! My love languages are acts of service and physical touch, and I truly value genuine connections with people. I cherish my close-knit group of friends, each of whom means the world to me. Life can be challenging at times, but I believe that having supportive friends and family makes all the difference.</h4>
