                    <h3>Love</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to relationships, I've experienced both the beauty and the challenges they bring. Each one has given me valuable lessons that have shaped me into who I am today. Coping with heartbreak was incredibly tough—there were moments when it felt like the world was crashing down on me. But with the support and love from those around me, I found the strength to keep going. The pain I felt made life difficult at times, but it also pushed me to grow stronger, more resilient, and more self-aware than I ever was before. The journey through these experiences taught me that while relationships can be filled with joy, they can also bring pain, and it's through facing that pain that we discover our true strength.</p>

                    <h3>School</h3>
                    <p>School has been a challenging journey for me, often leaving me feeling exhausted. My habit of procrastination only added to the stress and anxiety I faced. Yet, despite these struggles, school has been a place of growth for me. Moving forward can be tough, but life is all about pushing through, especially when it comes to education. I know that my success is something I want to share with my parents, and that thought keeps me motivated to never give up.</p>

                    <h3>Family & Friends</h3>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to my family and friends, they have always been there for me. Though I've encountered people who I thought were friends but ended up betraying my trust, I've learned that not everyone deserves that title. It's a hard lesson to accept, but it taught me not to trust easily or consider someone a friend if they don't treat me the same way. Despite that, I'm lucky to have true friends who stay by my side and understand me, no matter what. The same goes for my family. I am deeply happy to have them with me through thick and thin, supporting me despite all the stress I've put them through. Their patience and understanding mean the world to me, and I am so grateful to have them in my life.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>From all of this, I've learned that life is about surrounding yourself with people who truly care for you. Not everyone will be a friend, but those who are will be worth more than gold. Family and genuine friends are the ones who make life meaningful, and they are the ones who will help you grow and stay strong, even in the toughest times.</p>

                    <h3>Self</h3>
                    <p>Understanding myself wasn’t easy at first. I was naive, uncertain about who I was or where I was going. But the challenges I've faced have changed me. I've gone through tough times, cried countless times, and questioned everything about myself. There were moments when I felt like giving up, especially after breakups—whether it was a relationship or with a friend. But I learned that giving up isn’t the solution. Life is about embracing these hardships, no matter how overwhelming they seem. Every tear, every doubt, every heartbreak has made me stronger.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I’ve realized that these experiences, as painful as they were, are what shaped me into the person I am today. It’s easy to lose hope in those dark moments, but I’ve learned that those are the times when we grow the most. Even when it feels like the world is against me, I remind myself that there’s a bigger plan at work. God has something greater in store for me, even if I can’t see it yet. So, I choose to be patient, to trust that everything happens for a reason, and to believe that better days are ahead.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Life will always throw challenges our way, and it’s okay to feel lost sometimes. What matters is that we keep moving forward, even when the path isn’t clear. I’m ready to face whatever comes next because I know that every struggle I overcome makes me stronger and wiser. So, bring it on, life—I’m ready for whatever you have in store!</p>
